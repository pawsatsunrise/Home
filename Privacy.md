# Privacy Policy:

Last updated: 10 September 2025

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy outlines how Sunrise Design Limited collects, uses, and protects information when you use this app.

### 2. AGE LIMIT

This app is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 3. USER INFORMATION

This App does **not** offer registration, login, or account creation. We therefore do **not** collect any direct personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address, or phone number.

### 4. ANALYTICS & CRASH REPORTING

We use Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics, services provided by Google, to help us understand app performance, stability and reliability.

Nature of the Data: The data collected is non-personal, technical data that is aggregated and pseudonymized. It is linked to a unique, randomly generated instance identifier for your installation of the App (a "Firebase Installation ID"). This identifier does not reveal your identity and is not linked to your device's permanent hardware identifiers (like IMEI or MAC address) without your consent.

Purpose and Limitations: We use this data exclusively to analyze trends, diagnose crashes, and improve the overall quality of the App. We do not use this data to identify or track individual users. The technical and procedural safeguards implemented by us and Google are designed to make the identification of specific individuals from this dataset highly improbable.

Data Collected Includes:

1. Crashlytics: Technical information about app crash events (e.g., stack traces, device model, OS version, device state at the time of crash).

2. Analytics: Usage data such as session length, features used, app version, and approximate location which is non-precise (derived from IP address, e.g., country and city).

Legal Basis for Processing: Our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above is our legitimate interests in maintaining, analyzing, and improving the performance and stability of our App.

Data Access and Sharing: This pseudonymized data is processed by Google on our behalf as a data processor. Google is contractually forbidden from using this data for its own purposes beyond providing us with the Firebase service. You can review how Google handles this data in their policies:

Google Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) 

Firebase Privacy & Security Documentation [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

Data Retention: The pseudonymized data collected by Firebase Analytics is retained for a period of 14 months before being automatically deleted.

### 5. USER CONTROL AND OPT-OUT
1. Opting Out of Data Collection:

You can opt-out of all data collection for Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics at any time. To do this, please open the app, navigate to the "About the app" section, and disable the "Share Usage & Diagnostics Data" option.

Opting out of this data collection will not affect the core functionality of the app. Note: This opt-out will only apply to data collection from the point it is disabled.

2. Data Deletion:

The data we collect, as described in Section 4, is pseudonymized and is not directly linked to any of your personally identifiable information (such as your name or email address). The data is associated with a unique, randomly generated "Firebase Installation ID" for your app installation.

Due to the pseudonymized nature of this data, we have no technical means to link a specific user to their data, and therefore, we are unable to fulfill individual data deletion requests. We are unable to identify or delete data for a specific user.

However, we provide you with a full data reset option. This option will do two things:

It will disable all future data collection (same as the opt-out above).

It will reset the unique "Firebase Installation ID" for your app installation. This effectively makes all previously collected data for your app installation un-linkable to your device. Any new data collected will be associated with a new, different ID.

To perform a full data reset, please navigate to the "About the app" section and select "Reset Usage & Diagnostics Data."

### 6. ADVERTISEMENTS & IN-APP PURCHASES

This App does **not** offer in-app purchases or show advertisements. We therefore do **not** collect, store, sell, or share any information related to this.

### 7. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
