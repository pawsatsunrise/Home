# Privacy Policy:

Last updated: 10 September 2025

### 1. INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy outlines how Sunrise Design Limited collects, uses, and protects information when you use this app.

### 2. AGE LIMIT

This app is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 3. USER INFORMATION

This App does **not** offer registration, login, or account creation. We therefore do **not** collect any direct personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address, or phone number.

### 4. ADVERTISEMENTS & IN-APP PURCHASES

This App does **not** offer in-app purchases or show advertisements. We therefore do **not** collect, store, sell, or share any information related to this.

### 5. ANALYTICS & CRASH REPORTING

We (Sunrise Design Limited) use Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics, services provided by Google, to help us understand app performance, stability and reliability.

Nature of the Data: The data collected is non-personal, technical data that is aggregated and pseudonymized. It is linked to a unique, randomly generated instance identifier for your installation of the App (a "Firebase Installation ID"). This identifier does not reveal your identity and is not linked to your device's permanent hardware identifiers (like IMEI or MAC address).

Purpose and Limitations: We use this data exclusively to analyze trends, diagnose crashes, and improve the overall quality of the App. We do not use this data to identify or track individual users. The technical and procedural safeguards implemented by us and Google are designed to make the identification of specific individuals from this dataset highly improbable.

**Opt-Out:** You can opt-out of all data collection for Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics at any time. To do this, please open the app, navigate to the "About the app" section, and use the button to disable analytics & crash reporting.

Opting out of this data collection will not affect the core functionality of the app. Note: This opt-out will only apply to data collection from the point it is disabled.

Data Retention: The pseudonymized data collected by Firebase Analytics is retained for a period of 60 days before being automatically deleted. Crashlytics data is retained for 90 days before being **automatically deleted**.

Data Collected Includes:

1. Crashlytics: Technical information about app crash events (e.g., stack traces, device model, OS version, device state at the time of crash).

2. Analytics: Usage data such as session length, features used, app version, and approximate location which is non-precise (derived from IP address, e.g., country and city).

Legal Basis for Processing: Our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above is our legitimate interests in maintaining, analyzing, and improving the performance and stability of our App. We have balanced our interests in maintaining a reliable app against your privacy rights and concluded that given the data is pseudonymized and you have a clear opt-out, this processing is fair.

Data Access and Sharing: This pseudonymized data is processed by Google on our behalf as a data processor. Google is contractually forbidden from using this data for its own purposes beyond providing us with the Firebase service. You can review how Google handles this data in their policies:

Firebase Privacy & Security Documentation: [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).
